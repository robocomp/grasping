# Segmentation-Based Pose Estimation

This is an implementation of [Segmentation-driven 6D Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02541) paper based on the original implementation. This architecture is a single-shot segmentation-based network, in which the output points of interest and segmentation masks are fused using to RANSAC-based PnP  get the object pose.

Original implementation : https://github.com/cvlab-epfl/segmentation-driven-pose .

## Network Description

A brief description of network :

1)  The input to the network is a simple RGB image.
2)  The network has an encoder of Darknet-53 from YOLOv3, which is used for feature extraction of input image.
3)  The network, then, has two streams :
    -   Segmentation stream : to produce the output segmentation masks (pixel-wise object classification).
    -   Regression stream : to get 2D keypoints corresponding to the 3D keypoints of the object in the world (object) frame. Usually, the keypoints are 8 vertices of the 3D bounding box.
4)  The output 2D keypoints are used to solve a 2D-3D correspondance problem with the 3D keypoints, using RANSAC-based PnP to get object pose (extrinsics), knowing the camera intrinsics. Also, the segmentation masks are used to define object class.

## Installation

-   Install `python3` and `python3-pip`.
-   Run :
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

-   Download [YCB-Videos dataset](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/projects/posecnn/) or [Occluded-LINEMOD datset](https://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vislearn/iccv2015-occlusion-challenge/) .

-   Download [pretrained weights for YCB-Videos dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N-qI5dqFVSNryZ0WwKlLn7npDkyVs_eh/view?usp=sharing) or [pretrained weights for our custom dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GhN81L2lkgpmOqig9--cBX_7fFQM6NED/view?usp=sharing) . 

-   For training :

```
python train.py -ds dataset_name -dsp /path/to/dataset/root/dir -wp /path/to/weights/file -bg /path/to/background/images/dir
```

-   For visual inference (outputs to `./output` directory):

```
python test.py -gpu True|False -ds dataset_name -dsp /path/to/dataset/root/dir -wp /path/to/weights/file
```

-   For metric evaluation :

```
python eval.py -dsp /path/to/dataset/root/dir -op /path/to/output/poses
```

-   For API functions :

`api.py` contains two functions, `configure_network` and `get_pose`, for dealing with external calls (through a component, for example). 

```python
import api

model = api.configure_network()

predicted_pose = api.get_pose(model, img, class_names, intrinsics, vertices)
```

-   For network traced script (used in C++ deployment) :

```
python get_trace.py -cfg /path/to/config/file -wp /path/to/weights/file -op /path/to/output/file
```


## Training Info
